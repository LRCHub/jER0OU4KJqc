[00:08.60] Friday night, date night
[00:11.17] I say "Pick out what you like"
[00:13.46] I don't care as long as you're here
[00:17.57] Surprise, surprise, ain't that nice
[00:20.27] Same old chick flick, eighteenth time
[00:22.83] You know the one with that guy
[00:37.83] 
[00:26.70] Halfway through, look at you
[00:29.03] Smiling like you always do
[00:31.60] And I can't help but just stare
[00:35.62] 'Cause suddenly, it hits me
[00:38.34] As I watch you make believe
[00:40.74] I want to make this your reality
[00:56.74] 
[00:44.94] And if you'll be my leading lady
[00:49.41] Even though I may look crazy
[01:03.41] 
[00:53.36] I'll grab your hand, ask you to dance
[00:56.08] In the middle of the street
[00:58.06] Learn to sign, cheesy lines
[01:00.59] Like, "Baby, you complete me"
[01:03.27] And in case you forget
[01:04.85] Where we've been and what we did
[01:07.28] I'll write it all down, read it out loud
[01:09.54] Again and again
[01:12.02] I promise if you let me
[01:15.52] I'll love you like the movies
[01:30.02] 
[01:21.18] Now I've never been one of them
[01:23.57] Guys who could be leading men
[01:26.14] Just never seemed all that real
[01:28.26] ("Well you're like 5'6", "so was Tom Cruise, "True")
[01:54.26] 
[01:30.55] But here right now
[01:31.74] With you somehow
[01:32.70] The kind of love they write about
[01:35.16] Is the kind of love that I'm starting to feel
[01:57.66] 
[01:39.01] So I grab your hand, ask you to dance
[01:41.47] In the middle of the street
[01:43.33] Learn to sign, cheesy lines
[01:45.88] Like, "Baby, you complete me"
[01:48.61] And in case you forget
[01:50.34] Where we've been and what we did
[01:52.32] I'll write it all down, read it out loud
[01:54.71] Again and again
[01:57.06] I promise if you let me (what you gonna do?)
[02:00.76] I'll love you like the movies
[02:15.26] 
[02:03.45] I'll never let go, Jack, I'll never let go
[02:06.51] If you're a bird, I'm a bird
[02:09.37] You had me at hello
[02:18.87] 
[02:10.92] Like Noah loved Allie
[02:13.49] Like Harry loved Sally
[02:15.53] Like Richard loved Julia (twice)
[02:18.02] Like Tom loved Meg
[02:20.47] And the way he loved that volleyball (Wilson)
[02:24.59] The way Demi Moore loved that ghost (weird)
[02:27.11] The way Jack loved Rose (what?)
[02:29.01] I'll never let it go, never let it go (was he talking about a ghost?)
[02:31.63] Never let it go
[02:33.92] I'll never let go
[02:42.42] 
[02:41.60] ("Dude, you alright?" "I think so")
[02:44.89] Uh, if you'll be my leading lady
[02:48.36] ("It just seemed like it hurt")
[02:49.96] Even though I may look crazy ("It's very high")
[02:52.64] ("It did a little")
[02:53.71] ("Key change?" "Nah, I don't want to")
[02:56.27] ("I feel like we should do a key chan-" "Okay")
[03:19.77] 
[02:58.11] I grab your hand, ask you to dance
[03:00.82] In the middle of the street
[03:02.74] Learn to sign, cheesy lines
[03:05.24] Like, "Baby, you complete me"
[03:08.01] And in case you forget
[03:09.55] Where we've been and what we did
[03:11.78] I'll write it all down, read it out loud
[03:14.13] Again and again
[03:21.63] 
[03:16.36] Close your eyes, arms out wide
[03:18.75] "I'm the king of the world"
[03:20.79] Carpet ride, starry nights
[03:23.32] There's no way I don't kiss the girl
[03:26.36] And in case you forget
[03:27.87] Where we've been and what we did
[03:29.85] I'll write it all down, read it out loud
[03:32.36] Again and again
[03:39.86] 
[03:34.70] I promise if you let me
[03:38.17] ("Here's looking at you kid")
[03:41.33] ("Frankly my dear")
[03:42.80] I'll love you like the movies
